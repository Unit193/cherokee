		 Where can I find full documentation?
		 ====================================

This package comes from the 'cherokee' source package - In order to
avoid repeating the documentation all over the place, we have decided
to put it all in the 'cherokee' binary package. Please install it, you
will find the HTML documentation in /usr/share/doc/cherokee/
