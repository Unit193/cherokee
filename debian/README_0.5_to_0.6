	       Cherokee 0.6 configuration format change
	       ========================================

Cherokee 0.6 introduces a completely new configuration format, meant
to be machine-generated, and to be managed through the cherokee-admin
system.

The cherokee package ships the /usr/share/cherokee/05to06.py script,
meant to aid you migrating configurations. If you had installed
Cherokee 0.5.x, this script has been invoked already, at upgrade
time - The migration script will be mostly useful if you have
more than one master configuration (granted: This is a very uncommon
case). 

In case you want to review your hand-crafted configurations
were correctly migrated, you will find your original configurations at
/etc/cherokee/pre-0.6. 

To manage your configuration, launch cherokee-admin and connect with
your Web browser to http://localhost:9090/ - For further reference on
how to invoke it, refer to the cherokee-admin(1) manual page.
