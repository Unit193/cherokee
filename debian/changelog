cherokee (0.99.39-4.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for RC bugfixes.
  * Ship /var/www in the package, to ensure the install succeeds when nothing
    else providing it is installed yet.  Closes: #566526.
  * Do not call invoke-rc.d start in the postrm, even on upgrade - this is
    the responsibility of the postinst, which already has the automatic code
    to do this!
  * debian/cherokee.preinst: don't treat the 'install' case differently from
    'upgrade', there's no reason for a different code path here.
  * debian/cherokee.preinst: fix up the path to cherokee.conf, this has been
    in /etc/cherokee, not /etc, at least as far back as etch.
  * debian/cherokee.preinst: make the pre-0.6 migration code more resistant
    to interrupts (though not completely idempotent).

cherokee (0.99.39-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Arch-specific files were moved to its binary package in the "binary"
    target instead of the "binary-arch" target, causing buildd-generated
    packages to lack all plugins. Fixed. (Closes: #565316)

 -- Gunnar Wolf <gwolf@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jan 2010 07:42:14 -0600

cherokee (0.99.39-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally uploading the DH7-based branch! Crossing my fingers... Note that
    this changelog entry will be re-closing already closed bugs (as it grew 
    over a parallel branch)
  * Merged libcherokee-mod-server-info back into libcherokee-server0, as it 
    has no outside dependencies. Added provides/conflicts/replaces to allow
    for upgrades.
  * Update config.{guess,sub} before building (Closes: #549965). 
  * Switched to 3.0 (quilt) source format 
    + Dropped build-dependency on quilt
    + Documented existing patches according to DEP3
    + Debian "powered by" logo now included as straight PNG, no longer 
      uuencoded; dropped build-dependency on sharutils
  * Merged in changes made to the branch being uploaded to unstable
    + Properly remove backup directories for old configfile migrations on purge
    + Use dpkg-statoverride instead of dirtily chowning the log directory in
      postinst; don't mess with individual files in it
    + Fix libcherokee-mod-rrd not to break when server runs under a user
      other than www-data
    + Included upstream's config file migrator as part of the preinst
      process
    + Removes the symlinks in /var/www at purge time (Closes: #554889)
