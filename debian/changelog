cherokee (0.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * New upstream release

cherokee (0.7.2-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed spurious lintian warning due to multiline-command linebreaked
    at the wrong point
  * Included a call to dh_pysupport on /usr/share/cherokee/admin, to
    prevent unmanaged .pyc files from staying after package removal. Of
    course, added build-dependency on python-support. (Closes: #497427)

 -- Gunnar Wolf <gwolf@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Sep 2008 12:14:21 -0500

  * Moved the default HTML document to /usr/share/cherokee/default-site,
    sym-linking it to /var/www in case it is empty (keeping lintian
    happy, and in compliance with FHS chapter 5)
  * The administration handler will no longer assumes port 4000 is free
    for starting its SCGI communication (Closes: #479346)
  * Upstream uses a multi-level hierarchy for handling the versions :-/
    Now debian/watch follows the 0.7 series
