It is embeddable and extensible with plug-ins. It supports on-the-fly configuration by reading files or strings, TLS/SSL (via GNUTLS or OpenSSL), virtual hosts, authentication, cache friendly features, PHP, custom error management, and much more." />

<div class="paragraph"><p>There is not much to learn to configure PHP with Cherokee.
Cherokee-admin ships a one-click wizard that will do everything for
you. It will look for the PHP interpreter, it will check whether it
support FastCGI, and then it&#8217;ll perform all the necessary operations
to set it up on Cherokee. It is a piece of cake.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If PHP-fpm binaries are found, those will be prioritized over the
regular binaries.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It requires a single operation to get PHP configured on a Virtual
Server: Choose the virtual server your want to configure, and click on
the <tt>Behavior</tt> tab. Once in there, click on <tt>Wizards</tt>:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Now select <tt>Languages</tt> and run the PHP wizard. And, that&#8217;s it. If you
had <tt>php-cgi</tt> installed in your system, PHP should be configured now.</p></div>
<h3 id="php_fastcgi">PHP FastCGI support</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that only FastCGI-enabled binaries of PHP will work with the
FastCGI handler. Many prepackaged versions already enable this by
default. If yours does not, you will need to build a suitable
binary. You can check this with the <tt>-v</tt> parameter:</p></div>

PHP 5.2.10 (cgi-fcgi) (built: Jul 11 2009 15:33:11)

<div class="paragraph"><p>You cannot proceed unless the <strong>"cgi-fcgi"</strong> string is present.</p></div>
<h3 id="php_env">PHP process Environment Variables</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN</strong> environment variable is mandatory for PHP
FastCGI servers.  It defines how much children should serve the
requests coming from the webserver.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you define <strong>PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS</strong>, the value must be negative if
you do not want the PHP process to ever be restarted. If you leave it
unset, PHP will take the default value (500), after which it will be
restarted. It is generally a good idea to let PHP be restarted to free
up resources and possible memory leaks.</p></div>
<h3 id="advanced">Advanced configuration</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once PHP is configured, you are free to tweak the configuration to
adapt it to your specific needs. You may want to change some of the
php-cgi parameters, or even point Cherokee to use distributed PHP
execution.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This example shows a typical usage of FastCGI. It only uses one
<a href="config_info_sources.html">information source</a> nicknamed <tt>php</tt> in
this case. This connects to a FastCGI server located in localhost in
port 47990. If no server is running, the webserver will run the
FastCGI server by issuing the command defined as the <strong>Interpreter</strong>
sub-parameter:</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This other example shows a typical usage of multiple FastCGI servers.
It connects to FastCGI servers in several locations. If no server is
running in the local computer, the webserver will run the FastCGI
server by issuing the specified command. Note that for <strong>remote</strong>
FastCGI servers, you are responsible of running the FastCGI services
there manually:</p></div>
