    <meta name="Description" content="Cherokee is a flexible, very fast, lightweight Web server. It is implemented entirely in C, and has no dependencies beyond a standard C library. It is embeddable and extensible with plug-ins. It supports on-the-fly configuration by reading files or strings, TLS/SSL (via GNUTLS or OpenSSL), virtual hosts, authentication, cache friendly features, PHP, custom error management, and much more." />

</div></div>
<h3 id="faq06">How to access cherokee-admin from a remote machine</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>cherokee-admin binds only to local loopback by default. There are some
workarounds:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Create an SSH tunnel. This is the recommended way. In order to do so
  you must issue the following command:
</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>ssh -L 9090:localhost:9090 remote_IP</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After that you can access the remote interface through
  <a href="http://localhost:9090">http://localhost:9090</a> and every request will be forwarded to the
  remote IP running cherokee-admin.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Launch cherokee-admin with the -b parameter in order to force it to
  listen to all the network interfaces.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally you could always install cherokee on your local host,
  configure it there and then copy the generated cherokee.conf file to
  the device running the cherokee instance you wanted to set up.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h3 id="faq07">How to manually write configuration files without cherokee-admin</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The configuration file is a plain text file and its syntax is well
documented. Check the <a href="dev_cherokee.conf.html">cherokee.conf</a>
internal format information. Notice that manually editing the
configuration is not the recommended method, but the format will
always be kept updated to facilitate scripting tasks, working with
embedded devices and other similar situations.</p></div>
<h3 id="faq08">Does Cherokee speak WSGI natively like <tt>mod_wsgi</tt> does?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In short: no. We believe that we should not implement anything like
<tt>mod_wsgi</tt> for a number of reasons.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
First, and purely from an architectural point, embedding an
interpreter into the web server doesn&#8217;t feel quite right. Be it a huge
interpreter linked against dozens of libraries or be it something
using Python&#8217;s shared libraries, it doesn&#8217;t fit with the design
principles applied throughout Cherokee&#8217;s code base.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Second, it sounds hard to believe that <tt>mod_wsgi</tt> is faster than a
plain and simple SCGI application writing to a Unix socket: WSGI
applications can also use <a href="modules_handlers_fcgi.html">FastCGI</a> and
<a href="modules_handlers_scgi.html">SCGI</a> backends, which are fully
supported by Cherokee.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We believe Cherokee should be as fast, light, clean and secure as
possible, and to this end we tend to disregard bulky and monolithic
solutions. At least until we are given very, VERY, good reasons to
give it further consideration.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Give Cherokee (SCGI|FastCGI) a try with your WSGI application.  We
believe that besides fixing both the architectural and security flaws
you will improve performance.</p></div>
<h3 id="faq09">I need to make an administration script: What signals are supported by Cherokee?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The list is documented in the <a href="other_signals.html">Signals</a> entry.</p></div>
<h3 id="faq10">Is there a clean way of switching Cherokee to Maintenance mode?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Check the <a href="cookbook.html">Cookbook</a>, there is a
<a href="cookbook_maintenance.html">recipe on the subject</a>.</p></div>
<h3 id="faq11">What licensing is used by the Cherokee web server?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cherokee is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2,
which can be found in the file <strong>COPYING</strong> distributed with the source
code. For more details, read the
<a href="http://svn.cherokee-project.com/browser/cherokee/trunk/COPYING">full
license</a> in the project&#8217;s SVN repository.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If for whatever reason this license does not suit your needs, other
licensing schemes can be negotiated on a particular basis. Contact
<a href="http://www.octality.com/">Octality</a> if this is your case.</p></div>
<h3 id="faq12">And what about the documentation?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The documentation is distributed under a
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons
Attribution (by)</a> license, which is the most accommodating in terms of
what others can do with it. It lets others distribute, remix, tweak,
and build upon the work, even commercially.</p></div>
<h3 id="faq13">How can I contribute contents to the documentation?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The documentation is written and maintained using
<a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a>, a text document
format for writing short documents, articles, books and UNIX man pages
that can be easily translated to HTML and DocBook markups. It is
really easy to get the hang of it, so if you want to contribute,
please take a look at the
<a href="http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc">AsciiDoc Cheatsheet</a> and start
editing the documentation sources right ahead. They are distributed
with the source code and are located under <tt>./doc</tt> of the source tree.
If you don&#8217;t have SVN access, simply mail your contributions to
<a href="mailto:feedback@cherokee-project.com">feedback@cherokee-project.com</a>.</p></div>
<h3 id="faq14">Can encoders be set for specfic file types?</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Yes. Since content encoding is set on a per-rule basis, simply add a
rule at the beginning of the virtual server that matches the specific
file extensions and has the encoding enabled. Set the rule to be
non-final. That should do the trick.</p></div>
