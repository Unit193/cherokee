It is embeddable and extensible with plug-ins. It supports on-the-fly configuration by reading files or strings, TLS/SSL (via GNUTLS or OpenSSL), virtual hosts, authentication, cache friendly features, PHP, custom error management, and much more." />

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="para"><p>These Cherokee modules allow to balance the load among several
servers. Cherokee is completely modular, and thus a distinction must
be made clear.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Balancer modules only implement the balancing strategy. To actually
use one of these strategies you will need to select a
<a href="modules_handlers.html">handler</a> that makes use of balancers in the
<a href="bundle_cherokee-admin.html">cherokee-admin</a> interface. Besides
this, balancing strategies can be utilized both directly within first level
Cherokee handlers and as second level subsystems used by other first
level handlers. The <a href="modules_handlers_mirror.html">Generic
balancer</a> handler is an example of the former, while the latter would
be the case for the <a href="modules_handlers_fcgi.html">FastCGI</a> or
<a href="modules_handlers_scgi.html">SCGI</a> handlers that can offer load
balancing as well.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>These handlers can be chosen within the
<tt>Handler</tt> tab of the <a href="config_virtual_servers_rule.html">Rule
Options</a> section.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>When a specific balancing strategy is selected, there are two possible
settings as <strong>information sources</strong>:</p></div>
<div class="olist"><ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Remote</strong>: Cherokee will simply dispatch the request to the specified
  host. As many hosts as needed can be added, and Cherokee will simply
  apply the balancing strategy among them. If for any reason the
  requests made to these hosts could not be performed, the processes
  would simply fail.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Local</strong>: As before, many hosts can be specified (despite the name,
  the selection is not limited to the localhost). This works the same
  way as the previous option. But in this case, if a request cannot be
  responded then instead of failing directly a specified command would
  be launched before reconnecting to try again. Te most common use of
  this would be launching the service that should handle the request,
  but it is a flexible mechanism that in theory could allow you to
  reroute the information to allo you to serve SSH sessions via your
  webserver or any other neat tricks you can think about.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="para"><p>Note that because of Cherokee's flexibility and modularity, sometimes
and deppending of the situation one or the other setting might not
make much sense. In such ocasions <tt>cherokee-admin</tt> will simply hide
whatever options do not apply.</p></div>
